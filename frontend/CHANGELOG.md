### Console Logging
All pages now log API responses to help with debugging:
- Check browser console (F12) for detailed API response data
- Errors are logged with full error messages
- Helps identify API structure issues

## How to Test

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Navigate to different pages
4. Check the logged API responses
5. Verify that data is displaying correctly

If data still doesn't show, check the console logs to see the exact API response structure.
